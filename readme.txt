A Wordpress plugin to display customers and stores on a map.

== Description ==

This plugins contains two widgets :
- a simple and little one to be display on little place. When you click on this widget, it will load another page (to be choose in admin section)
- the second widget is a full map, based on OpenStreetMap and Nominatim. You will be able to see all retailers and search for place.
The idea of this widget is to have retailers informations stock on a geojson file, and be able to locate the nearest retailers for a customer.
